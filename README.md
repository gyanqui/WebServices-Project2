## 📚 Description

This project will provide an API for storing and retrieving information about contacts. These contacts will be stored in a MongoDB database and all interaction will happen through the API that I create. I will not need to create a frontend for this project, instead I am creating the API that could be used by any frontend in the future.

## 🛠️ Setup

- `npm install`
- `node server.js` starts up a local server and updates on any JS or CSS/SCSS changes.

## 🔩 Other commands
